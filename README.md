# Minishell 

The "Minishell" project is part of the curriculum at 42 school and is designed to introduce students to the world of shell programming. In this project, students are tasked with creating a Unix-like shell, allowing users to interact with their computer's operating system through a command-line interface.

This project was written in C, and it was developed in collaboration with Diogo Martins [(vlofast)](https://github.com/vlofast).

&nbsp;

The primary objective of the "Minishell" project is to develop a functional shell capable of performing the following tasks:

- Prompting: Display a shell prompt where users can enter commands;

- Parsing: Parse user input, breaking it down into executable commands and arguments;

- Command Execution: Users can execute system commands (e.g., ls, echo, cat) by entering them at the shell prompt;
 
- Built-in Commands: The shell supports built-in commands (e.g., cd, pwd, env) that interact with the shell environment;

- Input and Output Redirection: Users can redirect input from files and redirect output to files or other commands;

- Pipes: The shell allows users to create pipelines by connecting multiple commands, passing the output of one command as input to another; 

- Environment Variables: Manage and expand environment variables (e.g., HOME, PATH, USER) in commands;

- Error Handling: Provide informative error messages for invalid commands or system errors;

- Signals: Handle signals such as Ctrl+C and Ctrl+D, allowing users to terminate processes.

Through our journey with this project, we’ve had the opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of Unix-like operating systems and command-line interfaces. We were also able to improve our C programming skills by implementing shell functionality, including parsing, executing, and handling commands, and our problem-solving abilities, as the project continually presented us with diverse challenges.
